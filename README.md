## Features

+ Automated analysis of neuronal morphology skeletons that are digitally reconstructed from optical microscopy stacks. 
+ An easy context to load broken morphology skeletons and repair them manually. 
+ Sketching and building three-dimensional representations of the morphology skeletons using various methods for visual analytics. 
+ Automated reconstruction of accurate three-dimensional somata profiles, even with classical morphology skeletons that do not have any three-dimensional data of their somata. This approach uses the physics engine of Blender based on Hooke's law and mass spring models.
+ Automated reconstruction of polygonal mesh models that represent the membranes of the neuronal morphologies based on the piecewise meshing method presented by [Abdellah et al., 2017](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-017-1788-4).
+ High fidelity mesh reconstruction based on Skin modifiers as presented by [Abdellah et al., 2019](https://diglib.eg.org/xmlui/handle/10.2312/cgvc20191257). 
+ Fast mesh reconstruction based on union operators for rendering transparent meshes. 
+ Accurate mesh reconstruction with meta balls to create watertight meshes for reaction-diffusion simulations.
+ Automated generation of high quality media for scientific documents and publications using different shading styles and materials. 
+ Multiple interfaces: user-friendly graphical user interface, a rich command line interface, editable configuration files and a high level python API for python scripting.
+ Importing morphologies in multiple file formats including [SWC](http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html), [H5](https://developer.humanbrainproject.eu/docs/projects/morphology-documentation/0.0.2/index.html) or even from a [BBP circuit](https://portal.bluebrain.epfl.ch/resources/models/microcircuits-2/) using GIDs and cell targets. 
+ Exporting the reconstructed meshes in several file formats including [PLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)), [OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file), [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) and also as a Blender file ([.blend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#File_format)).
+ Parallel batch processing on multi-node visualization clusters using [SLURM workload manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/). 

# Package Details 

_NeuroMorphoVis_ is mainly based on [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Blender is a free software and can be downloaded from [Blender.org](http://download.blender.org/release/). Blender is released under the GNU General Public License ([GPL](https://www.blender.org/about/license/), or “free software”).
The current version of _NeuroMorphoVis_ is compatible with the following Blender versions:

+ [Blender 2.79](http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.79/)
+ [Blender 2.80](http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.80/)


+ [Blender 3.1](http://download.blender.org/release/Blender3.1/)
+ [Blender 3.5](http://download.blender.org/release/Blender3.5/)

Nevertheless, it is recommended to avoid version 2.79 and use version 3.5. 

_NeuroMorphoVis_ can be downloaded as a __binary archive bundled within Blender__ that can be easily extracted and used [out-of-the-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_box_(feature)). The optional dependencies are already shiped within this archive using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) on each respective platform. This package (released every minor version update of the software) is recommended for __Windows users__ or those who cannot use the [__Terminal__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell). Otherwise, users can just download an installation script that will automatically install the entire package to a user-specified directory. This script __does not__ require __sudo__ permissions. 


## Installation 
_NeuroMorphoVis_ can be installed to a user-specified directory from a Unix (Linux or macOSX) terminal. Installation procedures are available in this [page](https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroMorphoVis/wiki/Installation).   


## Downloading Package 

_NeuroMorphoVis_ packages are available for Ubuntu, RedHat, macOSX and Windows from the [__releases__](https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroMorphoVis/releases) page. After downloading the package, users can load NeuroMorphoVis into Blender as explained in this [page](https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroMorphoVis/wiki/Running-NeuroMorphoVis).   

# Interfaces

_NeuroMorphoVis_ is primarily designed as a plug-in in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). It comes with a user-friendly GUI and a rich set of command line options. Moreover, the tool is configurable via input configuration files making it possible to link it to web interface or using it on massively parallel visualization clusters for batch production. 

The tool is also extensible via its powerful python API that can be imported in Blender console and text browser. 

## GUI

To make it accessible to end users with minimal programming knowledge or even with no programming experience at all, the core functionality of _NeuroMorphoVis_ is exposed to users via a friendly graphical user interface that would allow them to navigate and adjust the parameters of the different toolboxes seamlessly. A detailed guide to use NeuroMorphoVis from its GUI is available in this [user guide](https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroMorphoVis/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface).

Note that the neurites are tagged with different colors (green for apical dendrite, red for basal dendrites and blue for the axon) and the soma (in yellow) is reconstructed as a realistic three-dimensional profile not as a sphere.</figcaption>

## Command Line Options

_NeuroMorphoVis_ has a rich command line interface that would make it easy to connect it to a web interface or use it to accomplish multiple tasks in an automated way. A list of all the command line options and their description are available in this [user guide](https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroMorphoVis/wiki/Command-Line-Interface).

## Configuration Files 

Users can easily configure and use _NeuroMorphoVis_ via editable configuration files. Instructions to write and use configurations files are available in this [user guide](https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroMorphoVis/wiki/Configuration-File).
